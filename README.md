# BankingProject
Bank Account System C++ Program using OOP 

This project I worked on helped me understand many advanced C++ concepts.
The program allows the user to make different Account Objects and deposit/withdraw a balance as well as display their current balance. The methods were overridden to have unique funtionalities on each different Account class type. 

I created a Banking Account system where the user can make specific Account objects such as Saving accounts and checking accounts. Each Account type has functions that are overridden to match the account type, for example, Savings accounts had implemented a deposit interest bonus. Each account has a unique functionality. I achieved this by inheriting the base Class "Account" and overrid the methods to work differently with each account type. The base class was structured to be a pure virtual class helped me understand the fundamentals of inheritance and polymorphism. This project helped me understand how to structure C++ programs into different files and implement advanced features which overall improved my C++ skills.

-the main.cpp file shows the functions in use.
-the .h files contain the classes that were used for this project
-the .cpp files contain the implementation of the methods for the class
